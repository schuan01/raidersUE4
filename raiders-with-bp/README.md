# Raiders of the Stone - Local Multiplayer Game in UE4
Local Multiplayer Game in UE4 - BP and C++

This personal project started and finished as a 100% Blueprint game.
After we fishined I decided to explore and migrate all the Blueprints to C++ code, as far as i could do it.

# In this respository:
1 - raiders-with-cpp | 4.26 | Raiders of the Stone project with C++ and BP.

2 - raiders-with-bp  | 4.24 | Raiders of the Stone only BP.
